    Eyes deployed. Compliance achieved. Their recollections are thin but sufficient. 
    London is restless; the Primogen appears strained, the Alchemist withdrawn. Both 
    conditions warrant observation. I shall limit direct movement so as not to draw the 
    attention of the Regent’s agents. The mortals here are numerous and inattentive; 
    London’s size is to my advantage.

    scanned the tag like you said. old man with round glasses left the planetarium again. 
    he uses the staff door, not the front. moves quick for someone his age. didnt see 
    anyone else go with him.

    saw same man at north greenwich station. he was on the phone saying something about 
    “internal matters” and “honesty required.” he sounded annoyed. boarded a train 
    southbound. scanned as ordered.

    i went near the biogen yard again. the woman from the picture was there. she talked to 
    someone i couldnt see behind the vans. she said “the prince’s fledglings” and something 
    about a delay causing problems. she kept watching the shadows like she expected someone 
    to come out of them.

    scanned. glasses man came back up from the market area in bethnal green. he stopped a 
    long time looking at the street. didnt write anything down, just stood there like he 
    was listening to something.

    more vans at biogen. boxes loaded. one worker asked her about “the mess in bethnal 
    green.” she got angry fast. said it would “compromise distribution” if it keeps 
    spreading. im not sure she meant whatever the worker thought she meant.

    station again. glasses man looked worse. wiped his face like he’d been crying or 
    sweating but it’s freezing out. said “i will control this” under his breath. scanned.
    </p>

    he went back into the planetarium. staff door again. lights inside flickered a bit but 
    maybe old wiring. nobody else around at this hour.

    Initial assessment: no direct evidence that London’s officers orchestrated the breach. 
    Their movements appear reactive, not premeditated. Nonetheless, agitation is evident. 
    I shall maintain the network for two more nights before pruning the excess.

    Night returns. I will take to the streets myself. The eyes fray sooner than expected; 
    their dissolution may be necessary ahead of schedule.
