    <p>
      Founded in the late 19th century by the enigmatic collector Alistair Pearse and his even more elusive
      partner known only as Penumbra, the shop has passed through many hands — each adding their own
      peculiarities to its collection. Its origins remain imperfectly documented. Even the earliest ledgers
      refer to “prior arrangements” and “existing contracts” that suggest the business predates the building itself.

    <p>
      Though the shop’s tone has modernised over the years, our philosophy endures: curiosity is a virtue.
      We value objects that evoke questions — the kind that linger, quietly, in the back of the mind.

      Whether you seek a Victorian locket, a handwritten postcard, or a natural specimen preserved with
      care, Pearse &amp; Penumbra offers items chosen for their character, history, and the sense of wonder
      they inspire.
