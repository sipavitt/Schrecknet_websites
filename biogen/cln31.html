<h1>Project CLN-31: Coagulation Linearity Evaluation</h1>

<p><b>Lead Researcher:</b> Dr J. Whitfield</p>

<p>
CLN-31 evaluates linearity across commonly used coagulation assays, including PT, INR,
and APTT, to verify instrument calibration standards in clinical laboratory settings.
</p>

<p>
Data gathered from 14 partner hospitals is currently under review. A full validation
report is expected at the end of the quarter.
